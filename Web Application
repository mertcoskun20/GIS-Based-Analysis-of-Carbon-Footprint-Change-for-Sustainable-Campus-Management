In line with my graduation project, I worked on "GIS-Based Monitoring of Carbon Footprint Changes 
for Sustainable Green Campus Management" in the context of the Paris Climate Agreement and the 
European Green Consensus, which are popular topics of the last years. The action plans for the carbon 
neutral goal emphasize the search for measures to enable digital technologies to accelerate and 
maximize the impact of policies to tackle climate change and protect the environment. In this study, 
which was carried out in accordance with this plan, the temporal changes of the carbon footprint were 
monitored through a GIS-based system at the Istanbul Technical University (ITU) Ayazağa Campus. 
In this context, first of all, the carbon footprint resulting from electricity, natural gas and fuel 
consumption on the campus were calculated and analyzed with a GIS-based system. The Information 
System in question is created with the ArcGIS web application, and it is aimed to help decision makers 
determine the relevant roadmap and effective policies. Carbon Footprint Monitoring and Analysis 
Information System was established by using Web Map plugin of ArcGIS Pro program. 
With this project, I took the third place in the Esri – Young Scholars 2022 competition that I 
participated in.
